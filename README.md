# âš¡ Parallax - Latency-Surface MVP Compiler

**Parallax** comes from physics, where perspective reveals hidden structure and depth.  
Just as parallax gives us a new dimension of understanding, this project aims to run **in parallel** to standard compilers, exposing a **new perspective on optimization**.  

This is the beginning of an open-source **latency-focused compiler harness**, inspired by quant finance workloads.  
The goal is to autotune low-level compiler transforms (loop unrolling, memory layout, prefetching, block placement, register allocation) for **tail latency performance** â€” specifically **p999 and beyond**.

## ðŸ”¹ Motivation

In ultra-low latency systems (like HFT), **the average cycles donâ€™t matter, the tails do**.  
During network microbursts, rare stalls (cache/TLB contention, branch mispredicts, spills) dominate **P99â€“P99.99 latency** and directly impact P&L.  

Traditional compilers optimize for throughput.  
**Parallax (Latency-Surface Compilation)** instead optimizes for:  
- **Tail risk (Quantiles / CVaR)**, not just mean latency  
- **Smoothness across execution paths**, flattening spikes in the latency surface  
- **Burst robustness**, ensuring decision times donâ€™t blow up under pressure

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

The project currently wraps a **CMake-driven micro-kernel benchmark harness**.  
It benchmarks three quant-style kernels:

- **Parser** â€” lightweight parsing workloads  
- **Ring Buffer** â€” queue-like data movement  
- **Order Book** â€” simplified market data kernel scanning price levels in both AoS and SoA layouts  

Execution is driven by `bench_main.cpp`, which batches iterations to stabilize measurements and writes per-call samples to CSV.  
Timing fidelity (`bench.hpp`) ensures cross-platform consistency and prevents compilers from optimizing away work.

An autotuning workflow (`run_search.py`) sweeps transform parameters, rebuilds executables, runs benchmarks, and records latency distributions.  
Post-processing (`analyze.py`) and visualization (`plot_report.py`) summarize results and render **ECDF curves** to inspect jitter.
